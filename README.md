# Test Strategy for Mantas Decommissioning and Data Migration to AWS S3 and Snowflake

## 1. Background

At [Bank Name], the Mantas system has been instrumental in creating risk rating files, integral to our transaction monitoring (TM) process. However, with Mantas reaching its end of life, it is imperative to transition to a new system, Crimson, for generating these files. This transition includes migrating existing Mantas data from an Oracle database to AWS S3 and subsequently to Snowflake to ensure continuity and enhance data processing capabilities.

## 2. Purpose

The purpose of this test strategy is to ensure a seamless and error-free migration of data from Mantas to AWS S3 and then to Snowflake. Our objectives include verifying data integrity, ensuring data consistency and completeness, and confirming that the new setup meets all operational requirements.

## 3. Scope

### In Scope

- Data extraction, transformation (if applicable), and loading processes from the Oracle database to AWS S3 and Snowflake.
- Validation of data integrity and consistency post-migration in Snowflake compared to the source system (Mantas).
- Integration testing between Crimson, AWS S3, and Snowflake to ensure end-to-end functionality.

### Out of Scope

- Testing of systems and functionalities not directly related to the data migration process.
- Future enhancements or features unrelated to the immediate migration.

## 4. Test Approach

- **Data Validation**: Implement a combination of automated and manual checks to validate data at various stages - post-extraction, post-load into S3, and after insertion into Snowflake. Employ checksum verification, record counts, and spot-checking of data samples.
- **Functional Testing**: Conduct tests to verify that all functionalities around data extraction, loading, and processing in Snowflake are working as intended.
- **Integration Testing**: Test the data flow and interaction between Crimson, AWS S3, and Snowflake, ensuring that the system operates seamlessly with the new data source.
- **Regression Testing**: Validate that existing systems interacting with the data store remain unaffected post-migration.

## 5. Test Environment

- The test environment will mirror the production setup, with isolated instances of the Oracle database, AWS S3, and Snowflake.
- Data used in the test environment will be anonymized or masked to ensure compliance with data privacy standards.

## 6. Test Data

- Test data will encompass a representative subset of the actual data, covering various scenarios and data types. It will include data known to cause issues in the past, along with standard operational data.
- The volume of data selected for testing will simulate realistic operational loads to gauge performance under typical and peak conditions.

## 7. Test Deliverables

- **Test Plan**: A detailed document outlining the test cases, execution plan, and acceptance criteria for each phase of the migration testing.
- **Test Reports**: Comprehensive reports documenting the testing outcomes, issues encountered, and resolutions, providing a clear status of the migration readiness.

## 8. Risks and Mitigation

- **Data Loss or Corruption**: Implement rigorous backup strategies and validation checkpoints throughout the migration process.
- **Integration Failures**: Conduct thorough integration testing and have rollback procedures in place to address potential integration issues.

## 9. Conclusion

This test strategy is a foundational document guiding the systematic approach to testing the decommissioning of Mantas and the migration of its data to AWS S3 and Snowflake. By adhering to this strategy, [Bank Name] aims to ensure a smooth transition with minimal impact on operational continuity, setting a solid foundation for future data processing and analysis capabilities.
